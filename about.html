          Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p><br>

          <p>Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Who are you, my warranty?! I never loved you.</p><br>

          <p>I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Say it in Russian! Why would a robot need to drink? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</p><br>

          <p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</p><br>

          <p>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. I love you, buddy! With gusto.</p><br>
